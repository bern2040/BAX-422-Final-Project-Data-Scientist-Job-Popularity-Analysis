# BAX-422-Final-Project-Data-Scientist-Job-Popularity-Analysis

This project provides valuable insights for recruiters and job seekers in the data scientist job market, helping them understand the market dynamics and factors influencing job popularity. Based on Python language, we used Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries to scrape job listings for data scientists from LinkedIn and stored the acquired data in an SQL database for further analysis. During this process, we encountered challenges in avoiding LinkedIn's blocking mechanisms and accessing the HTML files, but we managed to overcome these obstacles in the end. Central to our investigation is the Data Scientist Job Popularity Analysis. By building a model that considers the number of applicants as the dependent variable against various independent variables, we can identify the elements most impactful to a job's appeal. This analytical framework enables a quantifiable assessment of job attractiveness, offering actionable insights for companies in their recruitment strategies and, thus, is very meaningful.
